- dont say "no" "I don't know" -> I havent explored that area yet, but if my job requires that I'd be more than happy to explore
- asking for help is very important 
- keep your speech concise -> curse-of-knowledge bias -> should i say "I can word my ideas well" or should I say "I'm articulate"
- be truthful but not necessarily honest. don't reveal too much, for example, "I'm going to startup and create the next Facebook", they don't need to know that.

Your strengths / weaknesses
===========================
I make sure that I account for the curse-of-knowledge bias
I study human behaviour & social psychology in my free time
We live in a fast-paced world, people seldom take the time to stop and lend a hand, which is where I come in, I love walking with others even if they're walking slow

As for weaknesses, I'm not a competitive person, I tend to hold my own lane
However,  this weakness is a strength in itself because it also makes me more proactive & less reactive.
It is highly unlikely that I will go ahead and learn a new technology just because its the new fad or is a "hot" topic.
